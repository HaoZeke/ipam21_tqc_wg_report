  abstract = {Hierarchical tensors can be regarded as a generalisation, preserving many crucial features, of the singular value decomposition to higher-order tensors. For a given tensor product space, a recursive decomposition of the set of coordinates into a dimension tree gives a hierarchy of nested subspaces and corresponding nested bases. The dimensions of these subspaces yield a notion of multilinear rank. This rank tuple, as well as quasi-optimal low-rank approximations by rank truncation, can be obtained by a hierarchical singular value decomposition. For fixed multilinear ranks, the storage and operation complexity of these hierarchical representations scale only linearly in the order of the tensor. As in the matrix case, the set of hierarchical tensors of a given multilinear rank is not a convex set, but forms an open smooth manifold. A number of techniques for the computation of hierarchical low-rank approximations have been developed, including local optimisation techniques on Riemannian manifolds as well as truncated iteration methods, which can be applied for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations. This article gives a survey of these developments. We also discuss applications to problems in uncertainty quantification, to the solution of the electronic Schro¨dinger equation in the strongly correlated regime, and to the computation of metastable states in molecular dynamics.},

When a system features symmetries, these can be used to reduce computation costs substantially. It is straightforward to compute an MPP of a grand-canonical ensemble, also when symmetries are exploited. This paper provides and demonstrates methods for the efficient computation of MPPs of canonical ensembles under utilization of symmetries. Furthermore, we present a scheme for the evaluation of global quantum number distributions using matrix product density operators (MPDOs). We provide exact matrix product representations for canonical infinite-temperature states, and discuss how they can be constructed alternatively by applying matrix product operators to vacuum-type states or by using entangler Hamiltonians. A demonstration of the techniques for Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains explains why the difference in the energy densities of canonical and grand-canonical ensembles decays as 1/L.},

We further show that the third-order corrections can be efficiently implemented, in particular, when the resolution of the identity approximation is used for integrals. We also show that the CPS(D-3) excitation energies can be determined for system sizes that are far beyond what can be considered in conventional CCSD excitation energy calculations.},

  abstract = {We present release 2.0 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion systems. The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats, libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful framework for programmers to develop their own applications, which, for instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel, distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of HDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow provenance tool. The software is available from our web server at http://alps.comp-phys.org/.},

Because it is entangled, the reduced densities that describe subsystems also carry information about the complementary subsystem. This is in contrast to the classical marginal distributions on a subsystem in which information about the complementary system has been integrated out and lost. A training algorithm based on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) procedure uses the extra information contained in the reduced densities and organizes it into a tensor network model. An understanding of the extra information contained in the reduced densities allow us to examine the mechanics of this DMRG algorithm and study the generalization error of the resulting model. As an illustration, we work with the even-parity dataset and produce an estimate for the generalization error as a function of the fraction of the dataset used in training.},

At the physical values of the two couplings we find that BaOsO\$\_3\$ is still situated inside the metallic region and has a moderate quasiparticle renormalization \$m\^*/m \textbackslash approx 2\$; consistent with specific heat measurements. SOC plays an important role in suppressing electronic correlations (found in the vanishing SOC case) through the splitting of a van-Hove singularity (vHs) close to the Fermi energy, but is insufficient to push the material into an insulating van-Vleck regime. In spite of the strong effect of SOC, BaOsO\$\_3\$ can be best pictured as a moderately correlated Hund's metal.},

The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are given, with worked solutions in an ancillary file.},

  abstract = {A task-based formulation of Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm (SUMMA), a popular algorithm for matrix multiplication (MM), is applied to the multiplication of hierarchy-free, rank-structured matrices that appear in the domain of quantum chemistry (QC). The novel features of our formulation are: (1) concurrent scheduling of multiple SUMMA iterations, and (2) fine-grained task-based composition. These features make it tolerant of the load imbalance due to the irregular matrix structure and eliminate all artifactual sources of global synchronization. Scalability of iterative computation of square-root inverse of block-rank-sparse QC matrices is demonstrated; for full-rank (dense) matrices the performance of our SUMMA formulation usually exceeds that of the state-of-the-art dense MM implementations (ScaLAPACK and Cyclops Tensor Framework).},

  abstract = {Distributed-memory matrix multiplication (MM) is a key element of algorithms in many domains (machine learning, quantum physics). Conventional algorithms for dense MM rely on regular/uniform data decomposition to ensure load balance. These traits conflict with the irregular structure (block-sparse or rank-sparse within blocks) that is increasingly relevant for fast methods in quantum physics. To deal with such irregular data we present a new MM algorithm based on Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm (SUMMA). The novel features are: (1) multiple-issue scheduling of SUMMA iterations, and (2) fine-grained task-based formulation. The latter eliminates the need for explicit internodal synchronization; with multiple-iteration scheduling this allows load imbalance due to nonuniform matrix structure. For square MM with uniform and nonuniform block sizes (the latter simulates matrices with general irregular structure) we found excellent performance in weak and strong-scaling regimes, on commodity and high-end hardware.},

  abstract = {This paper shows how to build a sparse tensor algebra compiler that is agnostic to tensor formats (data layouts). We develop an interface that describes formats in terms of their capabilities and properties, and show how to build a modular code generator where new formats can be added as plugins. We then describe six implementations of the interface that compose to form the dense, CSR/CSF, COO, DIA, ELL, and HASH tensor formats and countless variants thereof. With these implementations at hand, our code generator can generate code to compute any tensor algebra expression on any combination of the aforementioned formats. To demonstrate our technique, we have implemented it in the taco tensor algebra compiler. Our modular code generator design makes it simple to add support for new tensor formats, and the performance of the generated code is competitive with hand-optimized implementations. Furthermore, by extending taco to support a wider range of formats specialized for different application and data characteristics, we can improve end-user application performance. For example, if input data is provided in the COO format, our technique allows computing a single matrix-vector multiplication directly with the data in COO, which is up to 3.6\$\textbackslash times\$ faster than by first converting the data to CSR.},

  abstract = {Many problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern/image recognition, signal processing and machine learning generate massive amounts of multidimensional data with multiple aspects and high dimensionality. Tensors (i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact representation for such massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank approximations. Big data analytics require novel technologies to efficiently process huge datasets within tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging technology for multidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor networks (TNs) and tensor decompositions (TDs) which represent tensors by sets of factor (component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor analysis allows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data and to perform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect relationships. We will discuss some fundamental TN models, their mathematical and graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale TDs and TNs, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection, feature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and integration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series analysis and multiway component analysis.

  abstract = {Developments during the last two decades in nuclear motion theory made it possible to obtain variational solutions to the time-independent, nuclear-motion Schrödinger equation of polyatomic systems as “exact” as the potential energy surface (PES) is. Nuclear motion theory thus reached a level whereby this branch of quantum chemistry started to catch up with the well developed and widely applied other branch, electronic structure theory. It seems to be fair to declare that we are now in the fourth age of quantum chemistry, where the first three ages are principally defined by developments in electronic structure techniques (G. Richards, Nature, 1979, 278, 507). In the fourth age we are able to incorporate into our quantum chemical treatment the motion of nuclei in an exact fashion and, for example, go beyond equilibrium molecular properties and compute accurate, temperature-dependent, effective properties, thus closing the gap between measurements and electronic structure computations. In this Perspective three fundamental algorithms for the variational solution of the time-independent nuclear-motion Schrödinger equation employing exact kinetic energy operators are presented: one based on tailor-made Hamiltonians, one on the Eckart–Watson Hamiltonian, and one on a general internal-coordinate Hamiltonian. It is argued that the most useful and most widely applicable procedure is the third one, based on a Hamiltonian containing a kinetic energy operator written in terms of internal coordinates and an arbitrary embedding of the body-fixed frame of the molecule. This Hamiltonian makes it feasible to treat the nuclear motions of arbitrary quantum systems, irrespective of whether they exhibit a single well-defined minimum or not, and of arbitrary reduced-dimensional models. As a result, molecular spectroscopy, an important field for the application of nuclear motion theory, has almost black-box-type tools at its disposal. Variational nuclear motion computations, based on an exact kinetic energy operator and an arbitrary PES, can now be performed for about 9 active vibrational degrees of freedom relatively straightforwardly. Simulations of high-resolution spectra allow the understanding of complete rotational–vibrational spectra up to and beyond the first dissociation limits. Variational results obtained for H2O, H+3, NH3, CH4, and H2CCO are used to demonstrate the power of the variational techniques for the description of vibrational and rotational excitations. Some qualitative features of the results are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A recurring theme in attempts to break the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of solutions to high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is to employ some form of sparse tensor approximation. Unfortunately, there are only a few results that quantify the possible advantages of such an approach. This paper introduces a class \$\$\textbackslash Sigma \_n\$\$of functions, which can be written as a sum of rank-one tensors using a total of at most \$\$n\$\$parameters, and then uses this notion of sparsity to prove a regularity theorem for certain high-dimensional elliptic PDEs. It is shown, among other results, that whenever the right-hand side \$\$f\$\$of the elliptic PDE can be approximated with a certain rate \$\$\textbackslash mathcal \{O\}(n\^\{-r\})\$\$in the norm of \$\$\{\textbackslash mathrm H\}\^\{-1\}\$\$by elements of \$\$\textbackslash Sigma \_n\$\$, then the solution \$\$u\$\$can be approximated in \$\$\{\textbackslash mathrm H\}\^1\$\$from \$\$\textbackslash Sigma \_n\$\$to accuracy \$\$\textbackslash mathcal \{O\}(n\^\{-r'\})\$\$for any \$\$r'\textbackslash in (0,r)\$\$. Since these results require knowledge of the eigenbasis of the elliptic operator considered, we propose a second “basis-free” model of tensor-sparsity and prove a regularity theorem for this second sparsity model as well. We then proceed to address the important question of the extent to which such regularity theorems translate into results on computational complexity. It is shown how this second model can be used to derive computational algorithms with performance that breaks the curse of dimensionality on certain model high-dimensional elliptic PDEs with tensor-sparse data.},

  abstract = {Matrix decompositions have always been at the heart of signal, circuit and system theory. In particular, the singular value decomposition (SVD) has been an important tool. There is currently a shift of paradigm in the algebraic foundations of these fields. Quite recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to outperform SVD at a number of tasks. Increasing research efforts are spent on the study and application of decompositions of higher-order tensors or multi-way arrays. This paper is a partial survey on tensor generalizations of the SVD and their applications. We also touch on nonnegative tensor factorizations.},

  abstract = {A multiscale density functional theory–quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (DFT-QM/MM) scheme is presented, based on an efficient electrostatic coupling between the electronic density obtained from a grid-based projector augmented wave (GPAW) implementation of density functional theory and a classical potential energy function. The scheme is implemented in a general fashion and can be used with various choices for the descriptions of the QM or MM regions. Tests on H2O clusters, ranging from dimer to decamer show that no systematic energy errors are introduced by the coupling that exceeds the differences in the QM and MM descriptions. Over 1 ns of liquid water, Born–Oppenheimer QM/MM molecular dynamics (MD) are sampled combining 10 parallel simulations, showing consistent liquid water structure over the QM/MM border. The method is applied in extensive parallel MD simulations of an aqueous solution of the diplatinum [Pt2(P2O5H2)4]4– complex (PtPOP), spanning a total time period of roughly half a nanosecond. An average Pt–Pt distance deviating only 0.01 Å from experimental results, and a ground-state Pt–Pt oscillation frequency deviating by {$<$}2\% from experimental results were obtained. The simulations highlight a remarkable harmonicity of the Pt–Pt oscillation, while also showing clear signs of Pt–H hydrogen bonding and directional coordination of water molecules along the Pt–Pt axis of the complex.},

We explore the geometry of the GSVD providing a long-sought-for  picture which includes a horizontal and a vertical multiaxis. We  further propose that the GSVD provides natural coordinates for the Grassmann manifold. This paper proves a theorem showing how the finite generalized singular values do or do not relate to the singular values of \$AB\^\textbackslash dagger\$. We then turn to  applications, arguing that this geometrical theory is natural for understanding existing applications and recognizing opportunities for new applications. In particular the generalized singular vectors play a direct and as natural a mathematical role for certain applications  as the singular vectors do for the SVD.  In the same way that experts on the SVD often prefer not to cast SVD problems as eigenproblems, we propose that the GSVD, often cast as a generalized eigenproblem, is perhaps best cast in its natural setting. We illustrate this theoretical approach and the natural multiaxes (with labels from technical domains)  in the context of applications where the GSVD arises:  Tikhonov regularization (unregularized versus regularized), genome reconstruction (humans versus yeast), signal processing (signal versus noise), and statistical analysis such as analysis of variance and discriminant analysis (between clusters versus within clusters.)  With the aid of our ellipse figure, we encourage the labeling of the natural multiaxes in any GSVD problem.},

  abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.},

  abstract = {Tensor network states are used to approximate ground states of local Hamiltonians on a lattice in D spatial dimensions. Different types of tensor network states can be seen to generate different geometries. Matrix product states (MPS) in D=1 dimensions, as well as projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in D{$>$}1 dimensions, reproduce the D-dimensional physical geometry of the lattice model; in contrast, the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) generates a (D+1)-dimensional holographic geometry. Here we focus on homogeneous tensor networks, where all the tensors in the network are copies of the same tensor, and argue that certain structural properties of the resulting many-body states are preconditioned by the geometry of the tensor network and are therefore largely independent of the choice of variational parameters. Indeed, the asymptotic decay of correlations in homogeneous MPS and MERA for D=1 systems is seen to be determined by the structure of geodesics in the physical and holographic geometries, respectively; whereas the asymptotic scaling of entanglement entropy is seen to always obey a simple boundary law -- that is, again in the relevant geometry. This geometrical interpretation offers a simple and unifying framework to understand the structural properties of, and helps clarify the relation between, different tensor network states. In addition, it has recently motivated the branching MERA, a generalization of the MERA capable of reproducing violations of the entropic boundary law in D{$>$}1 dimensions.},

In particular, we highlight the use of what we have defined as a complete active space-external space gap describing the basis splitting between the complete active space and the external part generalizing the concept of a HOMO–LUMO gap. Furthermore, the behavior of the energy error for an optimal basis splitting, i.e., an active space choice minimizing the density matrix renormalization group-tailored coupled-cluster singles doubles error, is discussed. We show numerical investigations on the robustness with respect to the bond dimensions of the single orbital entropy and the mutual information, which are quantities that are used to choose a complete active space. Moreover, the dependence of the ground-state energy error on the complete active space has been analyzed numerically in order to find an optimal split between the complete active space and external space by minimizing the density matrix renormalization group-tailored coupled-cluster error.},

The paper initially describes the technical details of the new software development platform. This is followed by brief presentations of many new methods, implementations, and features of the OpenMolcas program suite. These developments include novel wave function methods such as stochastic complete active space selfconsistent field, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, and hybrid multiconfigurational wave function and density functional theory models. Some of these implementations include an array of additional options and functionalities. The paper proceeds and describes developments related to explorations of potential energy surfaces.

Furthermore, the Article describes features unique to simulations of spectroscopic and magnetic phenomena such as the exact semiclassical description of the interaction between light and matter, various X-ray processes, magnetic circular dichroism, and properties.

After discussing the philosophy behind the ITensor approach, we show examples of each part of the interface including Index objects, the ITensor product operator, tensor factorizations, tensor storage types, algorithms for matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product operator (MPO) tensor networks, quantum number conserving block-sparse tensors, and the NDTensors library. We also review publications that have used ITensor for quantum many-body physics and for other areas where tensor networks are increasingly applied. To conclude we discuss promising features and optimizations to be added in the future.},

This can be achieved at virtually no cost, and in sharp contrast to existing methods based on the dampening of the moments, improves the spectral resolution rather than lowering it. We validate the method for the exactly solvable resonating level model and the single impurity Anderson model. It is capable of resolving sharp Kondo resonances, as well as peaks within the Hubbard bands when employed as an impurity solver for dynamical mean-field theory. Our method works at zero temperature and allows for arbitrary discretization of the bath spectrum. It achieves similar precision as the dynamical density matrix renormalization group, at lower cost. We also propose an alternative expansion, of 1−exp(−τH) instead of the usual H, which opens the possibility of using established methods for the time evolution of matrix product states to calculate the spectral functions directly.},

We analyze the real time-dependence of the double occupation after adding a single electron and observe oscillations at the same energy as the sharp feature in the Hubbard band, indicating a long-lived coherent superposition of states that correspond to the Kondo peak and the side peaks. For a two-band Hubbard model, we observe an even richer structure in the Hubbard bands, which cannot be related to a multiplet structure of the impurity, in addition to sharp excitations at the band edges of a type similar to the single-band case.},

Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides.

The subsystem hypervirial and the regional atomic theorems are presented in their local forms enabling one to introduce the tensor formulation easily. Accordingly, the two-component force, virial, torque, power, current and continuity theorems are introduced. Then, by proposing a model wavefunction for quantum nuclei, the nuclear stress tensor density is analytically evaluated. Based on the derived analytical stress tensor density, the regional nuclear properties are also computed analytically and their asymptotic trend at the infinite nuclear mass limit is inspected. It is demonstrated that in the infinite nuclear mass limit, the nuclear contribution in basin properties is null, while electronic contributions reduce to that computed within context of the orthodox quantum theory of atoms in molecules. Subsequently, the regional energies as well as the regional components of the potential energy are derived for two-component systems. The computed analytical equation for the nuclear contribution in basin energies is of particular importance. Finally, the electric dipole moment of a typical two-component system is decomposed into electronic/nuclear charge transfer and polarization contributions revealing the fine structure of the charge density distribution for both electrons and quantum nuclei.},

This renders the multigrid method, which has a well understood convergence theory, infeasible. A parameter-dependent representation, e.g., a low-rank tensor format, can avoid this exponential dependence, but in these it is unknown how to calculate the inverse directly within the representation. The combination of these representations with the multigrid method requires a parameter-dependent version of the classical multigrid theory and a parameter-dependent representation of the linear system, the smoother, the prolongation and the restriction. A derived parameter-dependent version of the smoothing property, fulfilled by parameter-dependent versions of the Richardson and Jacobi methods, together with the approximation property prove the convergence of the multigrid method for arbitrary parameter-dependent representations. For a model problem low-rank tensor formats represent the parameter-dependent linear system, prolongation and restriction. The smoother, a damped Jacobi method, is directly approximated in the low-rank tensor format by using exponential sums. Proving the smoothing property for this approximation guarantees the convergence of the parameter-dependent method. Numerical experiments for the parameter-dependent model problem, with bounded parameter value range, indicate a grid size independent convergence rate.},

  abstract = {Schur-Weyl duality is a ubiquitous tool in quantum information. At its heart is the statement that the space of operators that commute with the tensor powers of all unitaries is spanned by the permutations of the tensor factors. In this work, we describe a similar duality theory for tensor powers of Clifford unitaries. The Clifford group is a central object in many subfields of quantum information, most prominently in the theory of fault-tolerance. The duality theory has a simple and clean description in terms of finite geometries. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several applications: (1) We resolve an open problem in quantum property testing by showing that "stabilizerness" is efficiently testable: There is a protocol that, given access to six copies of an unknown state, can determine whether it is a stabilizer state, or whether it is far away from the set of stabilizer states. We give a related membership test for the Clifford group. (2) We find that tensor powers of stabilizer states have an increased symmetry group. We provide corresponding de Finetti theorems, showing that the reductions of arbitrary states with this symmetry are well-approximated by mixtures of stabilizer tensor powers (in some cases, exponentially well). (3) We show that the distance of a pure state to the set of stabilizers can be lower-bounded in terms of the sum-negativity of its Wigner function. This gives a new quantitative meaning to the sum-negativity (and the related mana) -- a measure relevant to fault-tolerant quantum computation. The result constitutes a robust generalization of the discrete Hudson theorem. (4) We show that complex projective designs of arbitrary order can be obtained from a finite number (independent of the number of qudits) of Clifford orbits. To prove this result, we give explicit formulas for arbitrary moments of random stabilizer states.},

  abstract = {The usual large-scale discretizations are applied to two or three spatial dimensions. The standard methods fail for higher dimensions because the data size increases exponentially with the dimension. In the case of a regular grid with \$n\$ grid points per direction, a spatial dimension \$d\$ yields \$n\^\{d\}\$ grid points. A grid function de…ned on such a grid is an example of a tensor of order \$d.\$ Here, suitable tensor formats help, since they try to approximate these huge objects by a much smaller number of parameters, which increases only linearly in \$d\$. In this way, data of size \$n\^\{d\}=1000\^\{1000\}\$ can also be treated. This paper introduces the algebraic and analytical aspects of tensor spaces. The main part concerns the numerical representation of tensors and the numerical performance of tensor operations.},

The achievable speedup and scalability of TD-DFT calculations is similar to those of ground-state calculations.

Here, we introduce developments and capabilities required to reach sustained performance, with AiiDA supporting throughputs of tens of thousands processes/hour, while automatically preserving and storing the full data provenance in a relational database making it queryable and traversable, thus enabling high-performance data analytics. AiiDA's workflow language provides advanced automation, error handling features and a flexible plugin model to allow interfacing with any simulation software. The associated plugin registry enables seamless sharing of extensions, empowering a vibrant user community dedicated to making simulations more robust, user-friendly and reproducible.},

Further speed-ups result from cheaper auxiliary calculations and an often greatly improved convergence behavior. Runtime to convergence improves by up to a factor of 2.5 on the Fermi-Hubbard model compared to the previous single-site method and by up to a factor of 3.9 compared to two-site DMRG.

The simulation protocols within the pyiron IDE are constructed using the Python programming language. To highlight key concepts of this tool as well as to demonstrate its ability to simplify the implementation and testing of simulation protocols we discuss two applications. In these examples we show how pyiron supports the whole life cycle of a typical simulation, seamlessly combines ab initio with empirical potential calculations, and how complex feedback loops can be implemented.

Showing unambiguously that a minimal model actually can have a superconducting ground state remains a challenge at nonperturbative interactions. We make a significant step in this direction by computing ground states of the 2D \textbackslash mbox\{U-V\} Hubbard model - the minimal model of the quasi-1D superconductors - by parallelized DMRG, which allows for systematic control of any bias and that is sign-problem-free. Using distributed-memory supercomputers and leveraging the advantages of the \textbackslash mbox\{U-V\} model, we can treat unprecedented sizes of 2D strips and extrapolate their spin gap both to zero approximation error and the thermodynamic limit. Our results for the spin gap are shown to be compatible with a spin excitation spectrum that is either fully gapped or has zeros only in discrete points, and conversely that a Fermi liquid or magnetically ordered ground state is incompatible with them. Coupled with the enhancement to short-range correlations that we find exclusively in the \$d\_\{xy\}\$ pairing-channel, this allows us to build an indirect case for the ground state of this model having superconducting order in the full 2D limit, and ruling out the other main possible phases, magnetic orders and Fermi liquids.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Hartree–Fock eigenvalue problem governed by the 3D integro-differential operator is the basic model in ab initio electronic structure calculations. Several years ago the idea to solve the Hartree–Fock equation by a fully 3D grid based numerical approach seemed to be a fantasy, and the tensor-structured methods did not exist. In fact, these methods evolved during the work on this challenging problem. In this paper, our recent results on the topic are outlined and the black-box Hartree–Fock solver by tensor numerical methods is presented. The approach is based on the rank-structured calculation of the core hamiltonian and of the two-electron integrals tensor using the problem adapted basis functions discretized on n×n×n\$n\textbackslash times n\textbackslash times n\$ 3D Cartesian grids. The arising 3D convolution transforms with the Newton kernel are replaced by a combination of 1D convolutions and 1D Hadamard and scalar products. The approach allows huge spatial grids, with n3≃1015\$n\^3\textbackslash simeq 10\^\{15\}\$, yielding high resolution at low cost. The two-electron integrals are computed via multiple factorizations. The Laplacian Galerkin matrix can be computed “on-the-fly” using the quantized tensor approximation of O(logn)\$O(\textbackslash log n)\$ complexity. The performance of the black-box solver in Matlab implementation is compatible with the benchmark packages based on the analytical (pre)evaluation of the multidimensional convolution integrals. We present ab initio Hartree–Fock calculations of the ground state energy for the amino acid molecules, and of the “energy bands” for the model examples of extended (quasi-periodic) systems.},

It leads to O(log n) complexity at computationally extensive stages in the rank-structured calculation with the respective 3D Hartree and exchange potentials discretized on large n×n×n Cartesian grids. The numerical examples for some volumetric organic molecules confirm that the QTT ranks of these potentials are nearly independent of the one-dimension grid size n. Thus, paradoxically, the complexity of the grid-based evaluation of the Coulumb and exchange matrices becomes almost independent of the grid size, being regulated only by the structure of a molecular system. As a result, the grid approximation of the Hartree-Fock equation allows to gain the high resolution with a guaranteed accuracy.},

Along with the traditional canonical and Tucker models, we focus on the recent quantics-TT tensor approximation method that allows to represent N-d tensors with log-volume complexity, O(d log N). We outline how these methods can be applied in the framework of tensor truncated iteration for the solution of the high-dimensional elliptic/parabolic equations and parametric PDEs. Numerical examples demonstrate that the tensor-structured methods have proved their value in application to various computational problems arising in quantum chemistry and in the multi-dimensional/parametric FEM/BEM modeling—the tool apparently works and gives the promise for future use in challenging high-dimensional applications.},

  abstract = {Operations with tensors, or multiway arrays, have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, tensors are represented or decomposed as a sum of rank-1 outer products using either the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) or the Tucker models, or some variation thereof. Such decompositions are motivated by specific applications where the goal is to find an approximate such representation for a given multiway array. The specifics of the approximate representation (such as how many terms to use in the sum, orthogonality constraints, etc.) depend on the application. In this paper, we explore an alternate representation of tensors which shows promise with respect to the tensor approximation problem. Reminiscent of matrix factorizations, we present a new factorization of a tensor as a product of tensors. To derive the new factorization, we define a closed multiplication operation between tensors. A major motivation for considering this new type of tensor multiplication is to devise new types of factorizations for tensors which can then be used in applications. Specifically, this new multiplication allows us to introduce concepts such as tensor transpose, inverse, and identity, which lead to the notion of an orthogonal tensor. The multiplication also gives rise to a linear operator, and the null space of the resulting operator is identified. We extend the concept of outer products of vectors to outer products of matrices. All derivations are presented for third-order tensors. However, they can be easily extended to the order-p (p{$>$}3) case. We conclude with an application in image deblurring.},

We find that SOC does not affect the correlation-induced renormalizations, which validates Hund’s metal picture of ruthenates even in the presence of the sizable SOC relevant to these materials. Nonetheless, SOC is found to change significantly the electronic structure at k points where a degeneracy applies in its absence. We explain why these two observations are consistent with one another and calculate the effects of SOC on the correlated electronic structure. The magnitude of these effects is found to depend on the energy of the quasiparticle state under consideration, leading us to introduce the notion of an energy-dependent quasiparticle spin-orbit coupling λ∗(ω). This notion is generally applicable to all materials in which both the spin-orbit coupling and electronic correlations are sizable.},

We develop a new intermediate language for tensor operations called concrete index notation that extends tensor index notation. Concrete index notation expresses when and where sub-computations occur and what tensor they are stored into. We then describe the workspace optimization in this language, and how to compile it to sparse code by building on prior work in the literature. We demonstrate the importance of the optimization on several important sparse tensor kernels, including sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM), sparse tensor addition (SpAdd), and the matricized tensor times Khatri-Rao product (MTTKRP) used to factorize tensors. Our results show improvements over prior work on tensor algebra compilation and brings the performance of these kernels on par with state-of-the-art hand-optimized implementations. For example, SpMM was not supported by prior tensor algebra compilers, the performance of MTTKRP on the nell-2 data set improves by 35\%, and MTTKRP can for the first time have sparse results.},

Tensors are often sparse and compound operations must frequently be computed in a single kernel for performance and to save memory. Programmers are left to write kernels for every operation of interest, with different mixes of dense and sparse tensors in different formats. The combinations are infinite, which makes it impossible to manually implement and optimize them all. This paper introduces the first compiler technique to automatically generate kernels for any compound tensor algebra operation on dense and sparse tensors. The technique is implemented in a C++ library called taco. Its performance is competitive with best-in-class hand-optimized kernels in popular libraries, while supporting far more tensor operations.},

Our result can be seen as a dissipative Church-Turing theorem, since it implies that under natural assumptions, such as weak coupling to an environment, the dynamics of an open quantum system can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer. Formally, we introduce a Trotter decomposition for Liouvillian dynamics and give explicit error bounds. This constitutes a practical tool for numerical simulations, e.g., using matrix-product operators. We also demonstrate that most quantum states cannot be prepared efficiently.},

  abstract = {A comparison of DFT methods Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics. RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain “precision” relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users. RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms. CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/351/6280/aad3000/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement. The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements. A survey of recent density functional theory methods shows a convergence to more accurate property calculations.

  abstract = {The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm is a powerful tool for solving eigenvalue problems to model quantum systems. DMRG relies on tensor contractions and dense linear algebra to compute properties of condensed matter physics systems. However, its efficient parallel implementation is challenging due to limited concurrency, large memory footprint, and tensor sparsity. We mitigate these problems by implementing two new parallel approaches that handle block sparsity arising in DMRG, via Cyclops, a distributed memory tensor contraction library. We benchmark their performance on two physical systems using the Blue Waters and Stampede2 supercomputers. Our DMRG performance is improved by up to 5.9X in runtime and 99X in processing rate over ITensor, at roughly comparable computational resource use. This enables higher accuracy calculations via larger tensors for quantum state approximation. We demonstrate that despite having limited concurrency, DMRG is weakly scalable with the use of efficient parallel tensor contraction mechanisms.},

We take the full Hubbard-Kanamori interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) into account. The MPS impurity solver works at essentially zero temperature in the presence of SOC, a regime of parameters currently inaccessible to continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods, due to a severe sign problem. We show that earlier results obtained at high temperature, namely, that the diagonal self-energies are nearly unaffected by SOC and that interactions lead to an effective enhancement of the SOC, hold even at low temperature. We observe that realism makes the numerical solution of the impurity model with MPS much more demanding in comparison to earlier works on Bethe lattice models, requiring several algorithmic improvements.},

Given such a PEPS representation, we show that the consistency conditions of its MPO symmetries amount to a set of six coupled equations that can be identified with the pentagon equations of a bimodule category. This allows us to classify all equivalent PEPS representations and build MPO intertwiners between them, synthesising and generalising the wide variety of tensor network representations of topological phases. Furthermore, we use this generalisation to build explicit PEPS realisations of domain walls between different topological phases as constructed by Kitaev and Kong [Commun. Math. Phys. 313 (2012) 351-373]. While the prevailing abstract categorical approach is sufficient to describe the structure of topological phases, explicit tensor network representations are required to simulate these systems on a computer, such as needed for calculating thresholds of quantum error-correcting codes based on string-nets with boundaries. Finally, we show that all these string-net PEPS representations can be understood as specific instances of Turaev-Viro state-sum models of topological field theory on three-manifolds with a physical boundary, thereby putting these tensor network constructions on a mathematically rigorous footing.},

These tensor methods are used for data analysis and simulation of quantum systems. In this work, we introduce AutoHOOT, the first automatic differentiation (AD) framework targeting at high-order optimization for tensor computations. AutoHOOT takes input tensor computation expressions and generates optimized derivative expressions. In particular, AutoHOOT contains a new explicit Jacobian / Hessian expression generation kernel whose outputs maintain the input tensors' granularity and are easy to optimize. The expressions are then optimized by both the traditional compiler optimization techniques and specific tensor algebra transformations. Experimental results show that AutoHOOT achieves competitive CPU and GPU performance for both tensor decomposition and tensor network applications compared to existing AD software and other tensor computation libraries with manually written kernels. The tensor methods generated by AutoHOOT are also well-parallelizable, and we demonstrate good scalability on a distributed memory supercomputer.},

At the same time, the paper is intended to be useful as an introduction to the physics of spin-triplet superconductivity. First, the authors show how the normal-state properties of Sr2RuO4 are quantitatively described in terms of a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi liquid. Then they summarize its phenomenological superconducting parameters in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau model, and discuss the existing evidence for spin-triplet pairing. After a brief introduction to the vector order parameter, they examine the most likely symmetry of the triplet state. The structure of the superconducting energy gap is discussed, as is the effect of symmetry-breaking magnetic fields on the phase diagram. The article concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues and desirable future work. Appendixes on additional details of the normal state, difficulty in observing the bulk Fermi surface by angle-resolved photoemission, and the enhancement of superconducting transition temperature in a two-phase Sr2RuO4−Ru system are included.},

However, at present, developing and studying algorithms for these problems can be difficult due to the prohibitive amount of domain knowledge required in both the area of chemistry and quantum algorithms. To help bridge this gap and open the field to more researchers, we have developed the OpenFermion software package (www.openfermion.org). OpenFermion is an open-source software library written largely in Python under an Apache 2.0 license, aimed at enabling the simulation of fermionic and bosonic models and quantum chemistry problems on quantum hardware. Beginning with an interface to common electronic structure packages, it simplifies the translation between a molecular specification and a quantum circuit for solving or studying the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer, minimizing the amount of domain expertise required to enter the field. The package is designed to be extensible and robust, maintaining high software standards in documentation and testing. This release paper outlines the key motivations behind design choices in OpenFermion and discusses some basic OpenFermion functionality which we believe will aid the community in the development of better quantum algorithms and tools for this exciting area of research.},

  abstract = {We present a tree-tensor-network-based method to study strongly correlated systems with nonlocal interactions in higher dimensions. Although the momentum-space and quantum-chemistry versions of the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method have long been applied to such systems, the spatial topology of DMRG-based methods allows efficient optimizations to be carried out with respect to one spatial dimension only. Extending the matrix-product-state picture, we formulate a more general approach by allowing the local sites to be coupled to more than two neighboring auxiliary subspaces. Following [Y. Shi, L. Duan, and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. A 74, 022320 (2006)], we treat a treelike network ansatz with arbitrary coordination number z, where the z=2 case corresponds to the one-dimensional (1D) scheme. For this ansatz, the long-range correlation deviates from the mean-field value polynomially with distance, in contrast to the matrix-product ansatz, which deviates exponentially. The computational cost of the tree-tensor-network method is significantly smaller than that of previous DMRG-based attempts, which renormalize several blocks into a single block. In addition, we investigate the effect of unitary transformations on the local basis states and present a method for optimizing such transformations. For the 1D interacting spinless fermion model, the optimized transformation interpolates smoothly between real space and momentum space. Calculations carried out on small quantum chemical systems support our approach.},

  abstract = {In this contribution to the special software-centered issue, the ORCA program package is described. We start with a short historical perspective of how the project began and go on to discuss its current feature set. ORCA has grown into a rather comprehensive general-purpose package for theoretical research in all areas of chemistry and many neighboring disciplines such as materials sciences and biochemistry. ORCA features density functional theory, a range of wavefunction based correlation methods, semi-empirical methods, and even force-field methods. A range of solvation and embedding models is featured as well as a complete intrinsic to ORCA quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics engine. A specialty of ORCA always has been a focus on transition metals and spectroscopy as well as a focus on applicability of the implemented methods to “real-life” chemical applications involving systems with a few hundred atoms. In addition to being efficient, user friendly, and, to the largest extent possible, platform independent, ORCA features a number of methods that are either unique to ORCA or have been first implemented in the course of the ORCA development. Next to a range of spectroscopic and magnetic properties, the linear- or low-order single- and multi-reference local correlation methods based on pair natural orbitals (domain based local pair natural orbital methods) should be mentioned here. Consequently, ORCA is a widely used program in various areas of chemistry and spectroscopy with a current user base of over 22 000 registered users in academic research and in industry.},

  abstract = {The popular methods of computational quantum chemistry (CQC) have acquired the status of “mainstream” quantum chemistry (QC), with countless useful applications to molecular science, especially for properties, potential energy surfaces, and reactions of the ground states. In earlier publications, four “ages of QC” have been defined, the classification having been based exclusively on the progress of QC in the direction of CQC. The core of the present article has a dual character: On the one hand, it is a commentary on the nature of QC, whereby it is argued that modern QC, while keeping its focus on the many-electron problem, (MEP), and on the consequences of Electron Correlations on observable quantities, has a domain and a scope that are larger than those determined, more or less, by CQC. Hence, additional “ages” are singled out and proposed, which are connected to “time-independent” and “time-dependent” theoretical “many-electron” formulations and calculations in which the “continuous spectrum” is involved explicitly. They are connected to experimental directions, which challenge theory to provide not only phenomenology but also quantitative answers and predictions for properties and phenomena involving various types of “unstable (nonstationary) states,” which decay irreversibly into the continuous spectrum either via interactions within the atomic (molecular) Hamiltonian (e.g., autoionizing states) or via the interaction with external electromagnetic fields. On the other hand, the article presents, in the form of brief reviews and retrospective accounts, a gleaning from our contributions to the theory and to methods of calculation for the quantitative treatment of such MEPs. Specifically, in the context of the previous paragraphs, I comment briefly on basic concepts, I point to early theoretical work, and, in support of the arguments, I refer to practical theoretical constructions and sample results regarding the following two themes: “resonances in many-electron systems” and “theoretical time-resolved many-electron physics.” Both the themes are connected to the recent developments on the experimental front of the interaction of atoms and molecules with ultrashort radiation pulses (weak or strong) in the femtosecond and attosecond regimes. The first theme is treatable within energy-dependent or time-dependent frameworks. The second one requires the computation of a physically transparent Ψ(t), which solves to a very good approximation the many-electron time-dependent Schrödinger equation (METDSE) for given characteristics of the pulses. Our approaches to related problems have been developed and implemented within state- and property-specific formulations. These are constructed in terms of energy-dependent Hermitian and non-Hermitian formalisms, as well as in terms of time-dependent ones, whose essential elements are explained here. In either case, in line with the main tenet of QC, the focus is on the understanding and efficient solution of the corresponding MEPs, especially in terms of nonperturbative methods. For time-dependent problems involving the interaction with strong fields, the solution of the relevant METDSE is carried out by applying the “state-specific expansion approach.” This type of calculation entails the solution of many thousands of coupled equations, where the input consists of bound–bound, bound–free, and free–free coupling matrix elements, on- and off-resonance with respect to the frequency of the pulse. As an example of a solution of a time-resolved many-electron process, I present snapshots of the time-dependent formation of the asymmetric profile of the He 2s2p 1P0 resonance state excited by a femtosecond pulse. This profile is formed within about 180 fs and is the same as the one which is well-known from theory and experiment on the energy axis. The domain and horizon of modern Quantum Chemistry are broader than those of its original component, namely, Computational Quantum Chemistry of the ground state. Hamiltonians can create energy- or time-dependent unstable states whose effects are measured inside the continuous spectrum. The understanding and practical solution of the corresponding many-electron problems can be carried out reliably, using state-specific, nonperturbative methodologies that solve the Schrödinger equation efficiently as a function of real or complex energies, or of time. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this paper we extend this construction to d-dimensional arrays (tensors) and suggest a new interpolation formula in which a d-dimensional array is interpolated on the entries of some TT-cross (tensor train-cross). The total number of entries and the complexity of our interpolation algorithm depend on d linearly, so the approach does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We also propose a TT-cross method for computation of d-dimensional integrals and apply it to some examples with dimensionality in the range from d=100 up to d=4000 and the relative accuracy of order 10-10. In all constructions we capitalize on the new tensor decomposition in the form of tensor trains (TT-decomposition).},

Here we investigate four different POTFIT-based methods for representing a general PES as such a structure, among them the novel random-sampling multi-layer Potfit (RS-MLPF). We study how the format and accuracy of the PES representation influences the runtime of a benchmark (ML-)MCTDH calculation, namely the computation of the ground state of the H3O2− ion. Our results show that compared to the SOP format, the MLOp format leads to a much more favorable scaling of the (ML-)MCTDH runtime with the PES accuracy. At reasonably high PES accuracy, ML-MCTDH calculations thus become up to 20 times faster, and taken to the extreme, the RS-MLPF method yields extremely accurate PES representations (global root-mean-square error of ∼0.1 cm−1) which still lead to only moderate computational demands for ML-MCTDH.},

  abstract = {Free fermion systems enjoy a privileged place in physics. With their simple structure they can explain a variety of effects, ranging from insulating and metallic behaviours to superconductivity and the integer quantum Hall effect. Interactions, e.g. in the form of Coulomb repulsion, can dramatically alter this picture by giving rise to emerging physics that may not resemble free fermions. Examples of such phenomena include high-temperature superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall effect, Kondo effect and quantum spin liquids. The non-perturbative behaviour of such systems remains a major obstacle to their theoretical understanding that could unlock further technological applications. Here, we present a pedagogical review of “interaction distance" [Nat. Commun. 8, 14926 (2017)] – a systematic method that quantifies the effect interactions can have on the energy spectrum and on the quantum correlations of generic many-body systems. In particular, the interaction distance is a diagnostic tool that identifies the emergent physics of interacting systems. We illustrate this method on the simple example of a two-site Fermi-Hubbard model.},

Computing ideal quantum state amplitudes for circuits of such and larger sizes is a fundamental step to assess both the correctness, performance, and scaling behavior of quantum algorithms and the fidelities of quantum devices. However, resource requirements for such calculations on classical computers grow exponentially. We show that deferring tensor contractions can extend the boundaries of what can be computed on classical systems. To demonstrate this technique, we present results obtained from a calculation of the complete set of output amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 27 in a 2D lattice of \$7 \textbackslash times 7\$ qubits, and an arbitrarily selected slice of \$2\^\{37\}\$ amplitudes of a universal random circuit with depth 23 in a 2D lattice of \$8 \textbackslash times 7\$ qubits. Combining our methodology with other decomposition approaches found in the literature, we show that we can simulate \$7 \textbackslash times 7\$-qubit random circuits to arbitrary depth by leveraging secondary storage. These calculations were thought to be impossible due to resource requirements.},

We then discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net), that has been tuned first to the demands of computational materials science. AiiDA’s design is based on directed acyclic graphs to track the provenance of data and calculations, and ensure preservation and searchability. Remote computational resources are managed transparently, and automation is coupled with data storage to ensure reproducibility. Last, complex sequences of calculations can be encoded into scientific workflows. We believe that AiiDA’s design and its sharing capabilities will encourage the creation of social ecosystems to disseminate codes, data, and scientific workflows.},

In what has become an increasingly standard approach, Kohn–Sham eigenenergies, generated from a DFT calculation with a strategically-chosen exchange–correlation functional “starting point”, are used to construct G and W, and then perturbatively corrected by the resultant GW self-energy. In practice, there are several ways to construct the GW self-energy, and these can lead to variations in predicted quasiparticle energies. For example, for ZnO and TiO2, the GW fundamental gaps reported in the literature can vary by more than 1 eV depending on the GW code used. In this work, we calculate and analyze GW quasiparticle (QP) energies of these and other systems with three different GW codes: BerkeleyGW, Abinit and Yambo. Through a systematic analysis of the GW implementation of these three codes, we identify the primary origin of major discrepancies between codes reported in prior literature to be the different implementations the Coulomb divergence in the Fock exchange term and the frequency integration scheme of the GW self-energy. We then eliminate these discrepancies by using common numerical methods and algorithms, demonstrating that the same quasiparticle energies for a given material can be obtained with different codes, within numerical differences ascribable to the technical details of the underling implementations. This work will be important for users and developers in assessing the precision of future GW applications and methods.},

  abstract = {The practical success of polynomial-time tensor network methods for computing ground states of certain quantum local Hamiltonians has recently been given a sound theoretical basis by Arad, Landau, Vazirani, and Vidick. The convergence proof, however, relies on "rigorous renormalization group" (RRG) techniques which differ fundamentally from existing algorithms. We introduce an efficient implementation of the theoretical RRG procedure which finds MPS ansatz approximations to the ground spaces and low-lying excited spectra of local Hamiltonians in situations of practical interest. In contrast to other schemes, RRG does not utilize variational methods on tensor networks. Rather, it operates on subsets of the system Hilbert space by constructing approximations to the global ground space in a tree-like manner. We evaluate the algorithm numerically, finding similar performance to DMRG in the case of a gapped nondegenerate Hamiltonian. Even in challenging situations of criticality, or large ground-state degeneracy, or long-range entanglement, RRG remains able to identify candidate states having large overlap with ground and low-energy eigenstates, outperforming DMRG in some cases.},

Three important roles for quantitative theory are outlined: (i) theory precedes experiment; (ii) theory overturns experiment, as resolved by later experiments; and (iii) theory and experiment work together to gain insight that is afforded independently to neither.

In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

Here we explore in detail the numerical frameworks and methods employed to deal with lowdimensional physical setups, from a computational physics perspective. We focus on symmetries and closed-system simulations in arbitrary boundary conditions, while discussing the numerical data structures and linear algebra manipulation routines involved, which form the core libraries of any tensor network code. At a higher level, we put the spotlight on loop-free network geometries, discussing their advantages, and presenting in detail algorithms to simulate low-energy equilibrium states.

  abstract = {In this work, a general, user-friendly method – ab initio ligand field theory (AILFT), is described and illustrated. AILFT allows one to unambiguously extract all ligand field parameters (the ligand field oneelectron matrix VLFT, the Racah parameters B and C, and the spin-orbit coupling parameter f) from relatively straightforward multi-reference ab initio calculations. The method applies to mononuclear complexes in dn or fn configurations. The method is illustrated using complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2) calculations on a series of well documented octahedral complexes of CrIII with simple ligands such as FÀ, ClÀ, BrÀ, IÀ, NH3 and CNÀ. It is shown that all well-known trends for the value of 10Dq (the spectrochemical series) are faithfully reproduced by AILFT. By comparison of B and f for CrIII in these complexes with the parameters calculated for the free ion Cr3+, the covalency of the Cr-ligand bond can be assessed quantitatively (the non-relativistic and relativistic nephelauxetic effects). The variation of ligand field parameters for complexes of 3d, 4d and 5d elements is studied using MCl63À (M = CrIII, MoIII, WIII) as model examples. As reflected in variations of 10Dq, B and f across this series, metal-ligand covalency increases from CrCl63À to MoCl63À to WCl63À. Using the angular overlap model, the one-electron parameters of the ligand field matrix are decomposed into increments for r- and p- metal-ligand interactions. This allows for the quantification of variations in r- and p-ligand donor properties of these ligands. Using these results, the well documented twodimensional spectroscopic series for complexes of CrIII is quantitatively reproduced. Comparison of the results obtained using CASSCF and NEVPT2 reveals the importance of dynamic electron correlation. Finally, the limitations of the AILFT method for complexes with increasing metal-ligand covalency are analyzed and discussed.},

Each contraction may be executed via matrix multiplication on a properly ordered and structured tensor. However, data transpositions are often needed to reorder the tensors for each contraction. Writing and optimizing distributed-memory kernels for each transposition and contraction is tedious since the number of contractions scales combinatorially with the number of tensor indices. We present a distributed-memory numerical library (Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF)) that automatically manages tensor blocking and redistribution to perform any user-specified contractions. CTF serves as the distributed-memory contraction engine in Aquarius, a new program designed for high-accuracy and massively-parallel quantum chemical computations. Aquarius implements a range of coupled-cluster and related methods such as CCSD and CCSDT by writing the equations on top of a C++ templated domain-specific language. This DSL calls CTF directly to manage the data and perform the contractions. Our CCSD and CCSDT implementations achieve high parallel scalability on the BlueGene/Q and Cray XC30 supercomputer architectures showing that accurate electronic structure calculations can be effectively carried out on top of general distributed-memory tensor primitives.},

We formulate, implement, and prove the correctness of MFBC for weighted graphs by leveraging monoids instead of semirings, which enables a surprisingly succinct formulation. MFBC scales well for both extremely sparse and relatively dense graphs. It automatically searches a space of distributed data decompositions and sparse matrix multiplication algorithms for the most advantageous configuration. The MFBC implementation outperforms the well-known CombBLAS library by up to 8x and shows more robust performance. Our design methodology is readily extensible to other graph problems.},

  abstract = {We explore the interplay of electron-electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling in the model Fermi liquid Sr2RuO4 using laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our precise measurement of the Fermi surface confirms the importance of spin-orbit coupling in this material and reveals that its effective value is enhanced by a factor of about 2, due to electronic correlations. The self-energies for the β and γ sheets are found to display significant angular dependence. By taking into account the multi-orbital composition of quasiparticle states, we determine self-energies associated with each orbital component directly from the experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the perceived angular dependence does not imply momentum-dependent many-body effects but arises from a substantial orbital mixing induced by spin-orbit coupling. A comparison to single-site dynamical mean-field theory further supports the notion of dominantly local orbital self-energies and provides strong evidence for an electronic origin of the observed nonlinear frequency dependence of the self-energies, leading to “kinks” in the quasiparticle dispersion of Sr2RuO4.},

Thus, AD has great potential in quantum chemistry, where gradients are omnipresent but also difficult to obtain, and researchers typically spend a considerable amount of time finding suitable analytical forms when implementing derivatives. Here, we demonstrate that AD can be used to compute gradients with respect to any parameter throughout a complete quantum chemistry method. We present Dif f iQult, a Hartree−Fock implementation, entirely differentiated with the use of AD tools. Diff iQult is a software package written in plain Python with minimal deviation from standard code which illustrates the capability of AD to save human effort and time in implementations of exact gradients in quantum chemistry.

Equations of motion for both spin only and coupled spin–lattice dynamics are first reviewed, including a detailed account of how magneto-mechanical potentials can be used to perform a proper coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. A symplectic numerical integration algorithm is then presented which combines the Suzuki–Trotter decomposition for non-commuting variables and conserves the geometric properties of the equations of motion. The numerical accuracy of the serial implementation was assessed by verifying that it conserves the total energy and the norm of the total magnetization up to second order in the timestep size. Finally, a very general parallel algorithm is proposed that allows large spin–lattice systems to be efficiently simulated on large numbers of processors without degrading its mathematical accuracy. Its correctness as well as scaling efficiency were tested for realistic coupled spin–lattice systems, confirming that the new parallel algorithm is both accurate and efficient.},

However, there is little theoretical understanding of how such a state might arise out of strong coupling physics in simple models. Although density matrix renormalization group has been a powerful tool for exploring strong coupling modulation phenomena of spin and charge stripe in the Hubbard model and the t-J model, there has been no numerical evidence of PDW within these models using DMRG. Here we note that a system with inversion breaking, C3v point group symmetry may host a PDW-like state. Motivated by the fact that spin-valley locked band structure of hole-doped group VI transition metal dichalcogenides materializes such a setting, we use DMRG to study the superconducting tendencies in spin-valley locked systems with strong short-ranged repulsion. Remarkably we find robust evidence for a PDW and the first of such evidence within DMRG studies of a simple fermionic model.},

  abstract = {Decomposing tensors into simple terms is often an essential step toward discovering and understanding underlying processes or toward compressing data. However, storing the tensor and computing its decomposition is challenging in a large-scale setting. Though in many cases a tensor is structured, it can be represented using few parameters: a sparse tensor is determined by the positions and values of its nonzeros, a polyadic decomposition by its factor matrices, a Tensor Train by its core tensors, a Hankel tensor by its generating vector, etc. The complexity of tensor decomposition algorithms can be reduced significantly in terms of time and memory if these efficient representations are exploited directly. Only a few core operations such as norms and inner products need to be specialized to achieve this, thereby avoiding the explicit construction of multiway arrays.  To improve the interpretability of tensor models, constraints are often imposed or multiple datasets are fused through joint factorizations. While imposing these constraints prohibits the use of traditional compression techniques, our framework allows constraints and compression, as well as other efficient representations, to be handled trivially as the underlying optimization variables do not change. To illustrate this, large-scale nonnegative tensor factorization is performed using MLSVD and Tensor Train compression. We also show how vector and matrix data can be analyzed using tensorization while keeping a vector or matrix complexity through the concept of implicit tensorization, as illustrated for Hankelization and Löwnerization. The concepts and numerical properties are extensively investigated through experiments.},

  abstract = {For the tensor PCA (principal component analysis) problem, we propose a new hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-\$\textbackslash ell\$ algorithm can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of \$\textbackslash ell\$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies. It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we 'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also apply to the related problem of refuting random \$k\$-XOR formulas. The results we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to \$k\$-XOR when \$k\$ is even. Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to algorithm design.},

This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10−9.

  abstract = {We solve nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using matrix product states (MPS). This allows us to treat much larger bath sizes and by that reach substantially longer times (factor ∼2–3) than with exact diagonalization. We show that the star geometry of the underlying impurity problem can have substantially better entanglement properties than the previously favored chain geometry. This has immense consequences for the efficiency of an MPS-based description of general impurity problems: in the case of equilibrium DMFT, it leads to an orders-of-magnitude speedup. We introduce an approximation for the two-time hybridization function that uses time-translational invariance, which can be observed after a certain relaxation time after a quench to a time-independent Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has become an indispensable numerical tool to find exact eigenstates of finite-size quantum systems with strong correlation. In the fields of condensed matter, nuclear structure and molecular electronic structure, it has significantly extended the system sizes that can be handled compared to full configuration interaction, without losing numerical accuracy. For quantum chemistry (QC), the most efficient implementations of DMRG require the incorporation of particle number, spin and point group symmetries in the underlying matrix product state (MPS) ansatz, as well as the use of so-called complementary operators. The symmetries introduce a sparse block structure in the MPS ansatz and in the intermediary contracted tensors. If a symmetry is non-abelian, the Wigner–Eckart theorem allows to factorize a tensor into a Clebsch–Gordan coefficient and a reduced tensor. In addition, the fermion signs have to be carefully tracked. Because of these challenges, implementing DMRG efficiently for QC is not straightforward. Efficient and freely available implementations are therefore highly desired. In this work we present CheMPS2, our free open-source spin-adapted implementation of DMRG for ab initio QC. Around CheMPS2, we have implemented the augmented Hessian Newton–Raphson complete active space self-consistent field method, with exact Hessian. The bond dissociation curves of the 12 lowest states of the carbon dimer were obtained at the DMRG(28 orbitals, 12 electrons, DSU(2) = 2500)/ccpVDZ level of theory. The contribution of 1s core correlation to the X 1Σg+ bond dissociation curve of the carbon dimer was estimated by comparing energies at the DMRG(36o, 12e, DSU(2) = 2500)/cc-pCVDZ and DMRG-SCF(34o, 8e, DSU(2) = 2500)/cc-pCVDZ levels of theory.},

  abstract = {CheMPS2, our spin-adapted implementation of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for ab initio quantum chemistry (Wouters et al., 2014), has several new features. A speed-up of the augmented Hessian Newton–Raphson DMRG self-consistent field (DMRG-SCF) routine is achieved with the direct inversion of the iterative subspace (DIIS). For extended molecules, the active space orbitals can be localized by maximizing the Edmiston–Ruedenberg cost function. These localized orbitals can be ordered according to the topology of the molecule by approximately minimizing the bandwidth of the exchange matrix with the Fiedler vector. The electronic structure can be analyzed by means of the two-orbital mutual information, spin, spin-flip, density, and singlet diradical correlation functions.},

Its underlying wavefunction ansatz, the matrix product state (MPS), is a low-rank decomposition of the full configuration interaction tensor. The virtual dimension of the MPS, the rank of the decomposition, controls the size of the corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached with the ansatz. This parameter can be systematically increased until numerical convergence is reached. The MPS ansatz naturally captures exponentially decaying correlation functions.

The QC-DMRG algorithm, its computational cost, and its properties are discussed. Two important aspects to reduce the computational cost are given special attention: the orbital choice and ordering, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian.

  abstract = {In problems involving approximation, completion, denoising, dimension reduction, estimation, interpolation, modeling, order reduction, regression, etc, we argue that the near-universal practice of assuming that a function, matrix, or tensor (which we will see are all the same object in this context) has \textbackslash emph\{low rank\} may be ill-justified. There are many natural instances where the object in question has high rank with respect to the classical notions of rank: matrix rank, tensor rank, multilinear rank --- the latter two being the most straightforward generalizations of the former. To remedy this, we show that one may vastly expand these classical notions of ranks: Given any undirected graph \$G\$, there is a notion of \$G\$-rank associated with \$G\$, which provides us with as many different kinds of ranks as there are undirected graphs. In particular, the popular tensor network states in physics (e.g., \textbackslash textsc\{mps\}, \textbackslash textsc\{ttns\}, \textbackslash textsc\{peps\}) may be regarded as functions of a specific \$G\$-rank for various choices of \$G\$. Among other things, we will see that a function, matrix, or tensor may have very high matrix, tensor, or multilinear rank and yet very low \$G\$-rank for some \$G\$. In fact the difference is in the orders of magnitudes and the gaps between \$G\$-ranks and these classical ranks are arbitrarily large for some important objects in computer science, mathematics, and physics. Furthermore, we show that there is a \$G\$ such that almost every tensor has \$G\$-rank exponentially lower than its rank or the dimension of its ambient space.},

  abstract = {The topology of the Fermi surface of Sr2RuO4 is well described by local-density approximation calculations with spin-orbit interaction, but the relative size of its different sheets is not. By accounting for many-body effects via dynamical mean-field theory, we show that the standard isotropic Coulomb interaction alone worsens or does not correct this discrepancy. In order to reproduce experiments, it is essential to account for the Coulomb anisotropy. The latter is small but has strong effects; it competes with the Coulomb-enhanced spin-orbit coupling and the isotropic Coulomb term in determining the Fermi surface shape. Its effects are likely sizable in other correlated multiorbital systems. In addition, we find that the low-energy self-energy matrix—responsible for the reshaping of the Fermi surface—sizably differs from the static Hartree-Fock limit. Finally, we find a strong spin-orbital entanglement; this supports the view that the conventional description of Cooper pairs via factorized spin and orbital part might not apply to Sr2RuO4.},
