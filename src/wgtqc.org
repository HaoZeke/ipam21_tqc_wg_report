* Context
** Scope
The broader context of this working group is to gain a broad understanding of
the use (and abuse) of tensor methods in quantum chemistry.  There is a lack of
coherent material accessible to members of the community. In particular, though
there has been a proliferation of user-friendly black box methods, there are
few, if any strategies to bring researchers to a point where they are able to
meaningfully contribute in a sustainable way to a software ecosystem.

Computational simulations have gained prominence as a third pillar of scientific
exploration, supplementing theory and experiment
cite:strangComputationalScienceEngineering2007,allenComputerSimulationLiquids2017.
For any given problem, the interplay between forming a theoretical model
consistent with experimental evidence is now augmented by numerical methods.
Numerical methods have risen to greater prominence due to their ability to
provide efficient models from large datasets (big-data and machine learning
models) however, in the physical sciences, they are of greater importance than
facilitating glorified fitting procedures. In quantum chemistry, computational
methods have been able to provide quantitative values (occasionally) at par with
experimental methods, heralding the "third age of quantum chemistry"
cite:richardsThirdAgeQuantum1979,schaeferMethyleneParadigmComputational1986,schaeferQuantumChemistryDevelopment1984.

An often overlooked aspect of the modeling process, involves the numerical
approximations and software implementation approaches to computational quantum
chemistry. Unlike theoretical results, or even experiments, more often than not
computational studies are not held to the same level of rigorous
reproducibility. Computational studies are often nigh impossible to replicate
due to the large amount of computational resources and time required. This,
coupled with the proliferation of commercial or simply closed source codes are
key drivers cite:pengReproducibleResearchComputational2011. The reproducibility crisis in computational quantum chemistry is
slowly being acknowledged
cite:rangelReproducibilityG0W0Calculations2020,lejaeghereReproducibilityDensityFunctional2016
and can only be exacerbated by the unfocused implementation of further numerical
methods.

Concurrently, the advent of computational methods has highlighted the lack of
communication between various scientific disciplines. Code in this sense
functions as an equalizer, allowing for a unified understanding of the nature in
which algorithms used in widely differing contexts can be in fact, similar in
implementation. As a relevant example, alternating least squares, used for
recommendation systems in the data-science literature shares much of its core
(numerical) concepts with the density matrix renormalization group method used
for obtaining ground state energies and observables from quantum systems.

** Quantum Chemistry
Quantum chemistry as will be used in this report can be understood as the
formulation of electronic structure problems for systems corresponding to real
materials. To keep the report to a manageable length we will neglect any
discussion of density functional theory in this section. The starting point for
such a discussion can be completely pragmatic, taking a classical Hamiltonian
and "quantizing" it with the transform of the momentum. A slightly more rational
explanation (following cite:yamaguchiNewDimensionQuantum1994) begins with
writing the molecular non-relativistic Schrödinger equation.

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equationB}[Molecular Non-relativistic Schrödinger]
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}𝛹=E𝛹
\end{equation}
\end{equationB}
#+end_export

With the normal notation of $\mathbf{H}$ being the Hamiltonian operatior, $𝛹$ being the total wavefunction, and $E$ as the energy eigenvalue. For most calculations of interest in quantum chemistry we denote the time independent Hamiltonian operator in atomic units by:

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equationB}[Non-relativistic time independent Hamiltonian]
\begin{equation}
\begin{multlined}
\mathbf{H} = -\frac{1}{2} ∑ᵢⁿ∇ᵢ²-\frac{1}{2}∑_{A}ᴺ\frac{1}{M_{A}}∇_{A}^{2} - ∑ᵢⁿ∑_{A}ᴺ\frac{Z_{A}}{r_{iA}} \\
+ ∑_{i>j}ⁿ\frac{1}{r_{ij}}+∑_{{A>B}}ᴺ\frac{Z_{A}Z_{B}}{R_{AB}}
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}
\end{equationB}
#+end_export

which is written out for $n$ electrons and $N$ nuclei with $∇²$ representing the
Laplacian operator. Electrons have indices $i$ and $j$ while each nucleus is
denoted by $A$ or $B$ with the second index deployed to prevent double counting an interaction. $M_{A}$ is the mass ratio of the nucleus to the electron,
$Z_{A}$ is the atomic number of nucleus $A$ and $r$ represents the distance,
where the lower indices clarify the objects between which the distance is being
measured.

This is often understood as being the sum of terms, namely (in order) the kinetic energy of the electrons, the kinetic energy of the nuclei and the potential energy contributions of nuclear-electronic, electronic, and nuclear interactions.

While details may be found in the standard literature cite:lewarsComputationalChemistry2016,cramerEssentialsComputationalChemistry2004,jensenIntroductionComputationalChemistry2017,szaboModernQuantumChemistry1996, typical approximations
involve being able to consider the nuclei to be "clamped" (the Born-Oppenheimer
assumption) and the adiabatic assumption (electronic motions follow the nuclei
-- timescale separation). This allows us separate the nuclear (constant at a
fixed geometry) and the electronic parts of the Hamiltonian as
cite:schaeferQuantumChemistryDevelopment1984:

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equationB}[Total energy after BO and adiabatic approximations]
\begin{equation}
\begin{multlined}
\mathbf{H}_{elec} = ∑ᵢⁿ\mathbf{h}(i) + ∑_{{i>j}}ⁿ\frac{1}{r_{{ij}}} \\
H_{elec}𝛹_{{elec}} = E_{{elec}}𝛹_{{elec}} \\
E_{total} = E_{elec} + ∑_{A>B}ᴺ\frac{Z_{A}Z_{B}}{R_{AB}}
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}
\end{equationB}
#+end_export

Where we have used the one electron operator $\mathbf{h}(i)$:

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equationB}[One electron operator]
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}(i) = \frac{1}{2}∇ᵢ²-∑_{A}ᴺ\frac{Z_{A}}{r_{iA}}
\end{equation}
\end{equationB}
#+end_export

The second term in $\mathbf{H}_{elec}$ is often written (under the
approximations considered) in terms of the coulomb ($J$) and exchange ($K$)
integrals as $∑ᵢᴺ∑_{j>i}ᴺ(J_{ij}-K_{ij})$ cite:jensenIntroductionComputationalChemistry2017.
Relativistic effects and the Dirac equation are not considered
here, though they are known to account for anomalous observations in systems
with heavy elements (e.g. group 12 dimethyl metal-carbon bond lengths, p block
ionization energy trends etc.) cite:dyallIntroductionRelativisticQuantum2007.

The essential feature of quantum chemistry is the potential energy surface, a
hypersurface which is defined by the potential energy of atoms over all possible
arrangements cite:cramerEssentialsComputationalChemistry2004. Describing this surface efficiently (a sampling problem) and subsequently forming (minimum energy) paths (a global
optimization problem) are the bedrock of a large segment of quantum chemistry
applications.

Methods of solving the equations described can be divided into the standard two
forms of treating partial differential equations numerically, that is by
considering a real space grid and mesh-less methods. In quantum chemistry, the
mesh-less methods are more common compared to the gird methods, however, for
tensor applications textcite:khoromskaiaTensorNumericalMethods2018 demonstrate
the superiority of using grids.

*** Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)
For an understanding of the mesh-free methods the LCAO framework
(textcite:dewarLCAOMOTheory1971 demonstrates this pedagogically for $H₂$). The LCAO
asserts that a molecular wave function can be written in terms of a linear
combination of a atomic orbitals, and each electron in the system can be
described by a single one electron wave function (the orbital approximation).
This neglects both static and dynamic correlations. The spin orbitals
(one-electron wave functions) are composed of three continuous variables for
space, and one spin parameter which is discrete and can take only two values
(often written as $𝛼$ and $𝛽$). However, the consideration of spin orbitals and
their product (known as the Hartree Product
cite:szaboModernQuantumChemistry1996) does not account for Pauli's principle,
that is, there are no restrictions on regarding the manner in which the spin
orbitals combine to form a molecular orbital and thus it fails for any system of
more than one electron. With the neglect of correlations,
we are able to separate the spin orbitals into spatial and spin segments. For
the Hydrogen molecule, we have two electrons and two protons which implies
twelve coordinates for the four particles, notwithstanding spin. In this
situation, we can write the spin orbital as $𝜓ᵢ𝜎ₛ$ where $𝜓$ is the spatial
portion of the orbital $x,y,z$ and $𝜎$ is the spin portion. A trial form of the
wave-function which satisfies the Pauli principle can be constructed by
expressing the molecular wavefunction as a normalized determinant composed of
spin orbitals, and this is the Slater determinant. In a multi-particle system it
is written as:

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equationB}[Multi-particle Slater determinant]
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \Psi(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_N) &=
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
  \begin{vmatrix} \psi_1(\mathbf{x}_1) & \psi_2(\mathbf{x}_1) & \cdots & \psi_N(\mathbf{x}_1) \\
                      \psi_1(\mathbf{x}_2) & \psi_2(\mathbf{x}_2) & \cdots & \psi_N(\mathbf{x}_2) \\
                      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
                      \psi_1(\mathbf{x}_N) & \psi_2(\mathbf{x}_N) & \cdots & \psi_N(\mathbf{x}_N)
  \end{vmatrix} \\
 &\equiv | \psi _1, \psi _2, \cdots, \psi _N \rangle \\
 &\equiv | 1, 2, \dots, N \rangle
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{equationB}
#+end_export

Although this form of the wavefunction is often taken to be the starting point
from which further corrections are derived, it should be emphasized that this is
still an ansatz, and other valid guesses for the wavefunction are equally valid.

The final approximation before obtaining the molecular wavefunction is to expand
the spatial orbitals as linear combinations of basis set functions which in
turn are often considered to be the self consistent field atomic orbitals of
individual atoms.
*** Configuration Interaction
We can obtain the effects of electron correlation in some sense by requiring a
solution in the form of a combination of slater determinants (distributing
electrons across various molecular orbitals) instead of a single slater
determinant. This is the underlying concept behind the configuration interaction
methods and these are based on the variational principle; aside from which they
are formulated in a manner analogous to the Hartree-Fock equations
cite:jensenIntroductionComputationalChemistry2017. We can write the wavefunction
as a linear combination of determinants, and the molecular orbitals used for the
exited Slater determinants are from a Hartree-Fock calculation. These orbitals
are then fixed, which makes this a constrained optimization problem. Formally,
we have cite:jensenIntroductionComputationalChemistry2017:
#+begin_export latex
\begin{equationB}[Configuration interaction wavefunction]
\begin{equation}
𝛹_{CI}=a₀𝛷_{HF}+∑_{S}a_{S}𝛷_{S}+∑_{D}a_{D}𝛷_{D}+∑_{T}a_{T}𝛷_{T}+⋯=∑_{i=0}aᵢ𝛷ᵢ
\end{equation}
\end{equationB}
#+end_export

Where we have denoted the relative excitation states w.r.t to HF configuration
with S, D, T for singly excited, doubly excited, and triply excited.

Perhaps more pertinently, though truncated CI methods are not in general size
extensive, the Quadratic CISD (QCISD) class of methods have enough high order
terms to ensure the results appear to be size extensive.

With that in mind, and given that the full CI methods can be thought to be
limited only by the basis set (as the formulation is rooted in the variational
principle), we *do not* expect that going to the full CI limit will change the
results substantially for smaller. However, since the full CI limit at a large enough basis
set might account for even more of the electron correlation, we might expect the
results to be even closer to experimentally observed values, barring
relativistic effects (see Fig. [[fig:relfull]]).

Similar to the variational approach, other approaches to systematically include
corrections to the basic wavefunction exist in the literature (coupled cluster
methods cite:lewarsComputationalChemistry2016,szaboModernQuantumChemistry1996, cluster perturbation series cite:baudinClusterPerturbationTheory2019), and readers are referred to the
literature cite:jensenIntroductionComputationalChemistry2017 for details and
strict equivalence relations with CI methods.
*** Second Quantization
Most of the quantum chemistry literature
cite:szaboModernQuantumChemistry1996,cramerEssentialsComputationalChemistry2004,jensenIntroductionComputationalChemistry2017
(cite:helgakerMolecularElectronicstructureTheory2000 is an exception) is
formulated in terms of wavefunctions, and with little reference to the discretized
second quantization formulation. Tensor networks and their studies pertaining to
the physical sciences are typically described in terms of the second
quantization formalism. This has bleed into the code structures as well, which
will have consequences discussed in a later section.
** Tensors
# ** Basics
# #+begin_export latex
# \lipsum[2-3]
Tensors, representing multi-dimensional arrays, are one fundamental data representation in HPC applications.
We use different fonts for tensors ($\T{X} \in \R^{I \times J \times K}$), matrices ($\M{A} \in \R^{I \times J}$), and vectors ($\V{x} \in \R^I$) in this paper following the work~\cite{Kolda:2009:survey}.
We assume an $N$th-order sparse tensor $\T{X} \in \R^{I_1 \times I_2 \times \dots \times I_N}$ with \nnz nonzeros in the subsequent context. 
\emph{Matricization} reshapes or folds all the elements of a tensor with at least order 3 into an equivalent matrix~\cite{Kolda:2009:survey}. 
For example, mode-$1$ matricization of a tensor $\T{X} \in \R^{3 \times 4 \times 5}$ would result in a matrix $\M{X}_{(1)} \in \R^{3 \times 20}$.
A \emph{slice} is a two-dimensional cross-section of a tensor, obtained by fixing all indices but two, e.g., $\M{S}_{::k} = \T{X}(:,:,k)$; A \emph{fiber} is a vector extracted from a tensor along a certain mode, selected by fixing all indices but one, e.g., $\V{f}_{:jk} = \T{X}(:,j,k)$.

* Implementations
** Algorithms
*** DMRG
The most well known applications of tensor methods in the context of quantum
chemistry have traditionally been in the context of replacing full CI
calculations with DMRG cite:chanDensityMatrixRenormalization2011.
** Languages and DSLs
The idea of forming programming languages which maximally combine expert
knowledge with performance oriented low level code is the basis of rationalizing
the existence of Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). It is not really that these
ideas are new cite:solomonikSparseTensorAlgebra2015, but they suffer from bitrot
over time. BLOCK is now meant to be used as a black box, and the source is not
distributed on Github; similarly, the Quantum Chemistry version of the [[https://solomon2.web.engr.illinois.edu/ctf/index.html#interface][cyclops
tensor framework]] (CTF) cite:solomonikMassivelyParallelTensor2014, [[https://github.com/devinamatthews/aquarius][Aquarius]]
cite:solomonikMassivelyParallelTensor2014 has also suffered from a lack of
development. CTF cite:levyDistributedMemoryDMRGSparse2020 is reasonably well
developed, but it has fallen behind in terms of speed compared to the later
stage libraries [[https://optimized-einsum.readthedocs.io/en/stable/][opt_einsum]] which can take advantage of dispatching efficiently
to specialized hardware.
** Quantum Chemistry Software
Quantum chemistry has suffered for many years as a retarded child of computer
science in terms of the communal adoption of closed source tools which can be
traced back to the original sin of Gaussian becoming closed source cite:gilesSoftwareCompanyBans2004. Lately,
there has been a slight re calibration of the community’s moral compass in a
positive sense, and several previously closed source packages have become
open-source (e.g. the GAP potentials). The veritable zoo of software
cite:sherrillElectronicStructureSoftware2020 developed cannot be enumerated in
any reasonable treatise and will be left to the discretion of the reader.

We note in passing that the difficulty in obtaining meaningful information from
the outputs of a standard quantum chemistry code has given the community many
new avenues of exploration including the entire field of computational material
sciences. For issues concerning insight the community tools focus on
visualization (OVITO cite:stukowskiVisualizationAnalysisAtomistic2010, VMD) or
structural analysis (d-SEAMS cite:goswamiDSEAMSDeferredStructural2020) for
molecular dynamics , and workflow flexibility for quantum chemistry. Flexibility
and reproducibility is ensured by meta-analysis methods such as those
implemented by [[https://www.aiida.net/][AiiDA]]
cite:pizziAiiDAAutomatedInteractive2016,huberAiiDAScalableComputational2020 or
[[https://pyiron.org][PyIron]] cite:janssenPyironIntegratedDevelopment2019, or the set of tools which
build off of [[https://gitlab.com/ase/ase][ASE]] (atomic simulation environment)
cite:larsenAtomicSimulationEnvironment2017 like [[http://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw][GPAW]]
cite:enkovaaraElectronicStructureCalculations2010,dohnGridBasedProjectorAugmented2017.

The crux of these tools is to maximally enable user-interactivity. However,
these tools do not typically work in an interchangeable manner at the level of
theory. Most quantum chemistry codes work in a pidgin syntax which

** High Performance Computing Considerations
* Conclusions
** Goals and Outputs
Given the scope defined in Section [[Scope]] and the asynchronous nature of the program, the goals were set in accordance to their discussion in the report.
*** Goals
Primarily, the working group focused on the following:
- Reconciliation of concepts between disciplines
  - Cross pollination of gainful concepts
- Understanding code structures and implementation methods
  - Scalability, interoperability with mathematical models, and documentation
  - Performance bottlenecks
  - Programming language considerations
- Identification of future directions and current challenges
- and the unique (virtual) circumstances under which the IPAM program involved
workflows towards the mitigation of the same.

It was hoped that a standard library could begin to be established, similar to the [[https://hpx-docs.stellar-group.org/branches/master/singlehtml/index.html][HPX committee]] cite:kaiserHPXStandardLibrary2020.
** Outlook
The purpose of outlining a grand unifying plan is to encourage the community to
partake in its eventual success. We emphasize that the time has passed for
disparate groups to struggle in closed source developments. Inclusive authorship
like the NWChem paper is a laudable and achievable goal as a community. The
recent successes of for-profit companies like Google and their ilk in academic
arenas should further serve as a wake-up call; it is only in their ability to
connect working scientists of various disciplines have their successes been
assured.  GPAW holds monthly developer meetings, Stan likewise has developer
hours, as do DeepChem and some other; however, these are still currently few and
far apart. Contrary to some beliefs, these have not diluted the ability of the
steering groups nor swamped the communities with frivolous demands. Recently,
even the Fortran steering committee has opened a public forum (in the form of
the J3 proposals repository) to bring more of the community into the decision
making process. Computational chemistry, once one of the early adopters of the
net has fallen behind, and it can only be hoped that programs like those held at
IPAM will be able to stem the flow of bad practices and secrecy.

Tensor algorithms are well defined within their niches and have seen successes
on data which is traditionally part of quantum chemistry. However, they need to
be merged with the nebulous lexicon of quantum chemistry. Many avenues are
unexplored, relativistic qc, electrostatics. Outlook, they're powerful,
expressive tools which need to be coerced into the qc lexicon for efficient use.
